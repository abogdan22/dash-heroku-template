    "According to the [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/25/gender-pay-gap-facts/), the United States has a gender pay gap where male counterparts tend to earn more then females for the same positions. This pay gap has remained steady for the past 15 years where, in 2020, women earned 84% of what men earned for both full- and part-time positions. Measurable factors that have explained these pay gaps include education, occupational segregation, and work experience. Other variables that are difficult to measure include gender discrimination, career disruptions such as motherhood, and greater caregiving responsiblities at home. Many Americans believe equal pay is necessary for gender equality and as such is a prominent issue in the United States.\n",

    "Since 1972, the [General Social Survey] (GSS) (https://gss.norc.org/About-The-GSS) has collected and studied data on American society to monitor and explain trends in behaviors, attidues, and opinions. Topics studied include but are not limited to civil liberties, crime/violence, national spending, mental health, morality, and social mobility. GSS considers itself the the single best source for sociological and attitudinal trend data for the United States studying society in general, the roles played by subgroups, and compares trends in the US to other countries.
